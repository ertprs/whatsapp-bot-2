# ★ Whatsapp-bot
## ー Information
* A whatsapp bot using [whatsapp-web.js](https://pedroslopez.me/whatsapp-web.js/) for my group class.

## ー Installation

```git
git clone https://github.com/LichKing112/whatsapp-bot.git
```
```bash
npm install
```

then


## ー Usage

```bash
npm run start
```

After that it will open a Chromium instance. Then it will redirect you to Whatsapp Web. Scan the QR code. (Scanning the QR code is a only one time use, because the QR details are saved in a file called session.json and when you active the bot again it uses the data from the json instead of re scanning a new QR code)

To deactivate bot type this in command line.
```bash
ctrl + c
```
